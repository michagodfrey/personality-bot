# Personality Bot

Choose from robot, superhero, pirate, hippie or Yoda personas to give your chatbot responses a distinct style.

This app uses OpenAI's API to generate the responses.

## Personalities

'Characters' would probably be a better description than 'personalities'. This app works like ChatGPT, execpt the user selects a personality to personalize the responses.
